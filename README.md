# DE10-Standard Switch Control Program

This project is designed for the DE10-Standard board and demonstrates how to control HEX displays, LEDs, and switches using a memory-mapped I/O system.

## Overview

The program interacts with three key hardware components:
    
- HEX Display: Displays various values based on user input.

- LEDs (LEDR): Lights up based on the current value or special operations.

- Switches: User controls that trigger different operations on the current value.
    
### Features

- Increment, decrement, multiply, and divide operations controlled by switches.

- Random number generation.

- Digit reversal.

- Value encryption using an XOR cipher.

- Real-time output to the HEX display and LEDs.

- Switch-based blinking LED functionality.

### Switch Operations

Each switch has a unique function, outlined below:

`API_KEY` 
`API_KEY` 
`API_KEY`
